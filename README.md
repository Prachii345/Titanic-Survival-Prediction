# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to build a **machine learning model** to predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and travel data.

## 🧠 Objective

To preprocess Titanic dataset, explore the data (EDA), handle missing values, and train classification models such as:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

Model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics to determine effectiveness in survival prediction.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand data distribution, detect patterns, identify missing values, and analyze survival rates across different features like **gender, class, age, and fare**. Visualization tools helped uncover key insights to guide model development.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for EDA)
- **scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
